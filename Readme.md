# Data
The dataset selected for the presentation is a dataset on **Housing Prices in Metropolitan Areas of India-Mumbai**. <br/>
The dataset includes 40 explanatory variables describing various aspects of new and resale houses in the metropolitan areas of India <br/>
Each instance includes:
<ul>
    <li>Collection of prices of new and resale houses located in the metropolitan areas of India.</li>
    <li>the amenities provided for each house</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Note: Since for a set of houses, nothing was mentioned about certain amenities, '9' was used to mark such values, which could indicate the absence of information about the apartment but these values don't ascertain the absence of such a feature in real life

# Aim
To predict the final price of houses in these regions.
