# Data
The dataset selected for the presentation is a dataset on **Red Wine Quality**. <br/>
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. <br/>
Each instance includes:
<ul>
    
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
</ul>
<br/>


# Aim
Use machine learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine 'good'!

<br/>

# Exploratory data analysis

<br/>

# Choosing the machine learning model
